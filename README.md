# A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to how $UBI makes Ethereum transactions accesible for everyone.

$UBI's mission is to make Ethereum accessible again. For everyone. 
But mass adoption is impossible without education. To advance $UBI's goal, we created a guide into Ethereum for the absolute beginner. Find it on [human.money](human.money).

We invite you to propose changes and add new pages, as you desire. Our goal with this project was to create the foundation for a collaborative project beyond ourselves.
So your pull requests are very welcome.
