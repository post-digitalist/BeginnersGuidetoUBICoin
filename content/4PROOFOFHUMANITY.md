# Proof of Humanity

Proof of humanity is a registry of tokenized identities subject to joint review, developed by Kleros

Profile requests are approved by members to verify that they are human, but may then be challenged by members if there is any doubt about a duplicate profile.

If a bot or a duplicate profile is detected, they are deleted from the network and barred from claiming $ UBI in the future.

Whoever wants to challenge a user profile, will put a small portion of their assets at stake, that can be lost if they wrongly judge a profile as false, generating a healthy moderation incentive.

By forming a network of trust between non-duplicated and non-automated identities, a much more democratic governance system can be developed, where each person is assigned a vote, rather than a plutocratic system.

In this sense, each user with a VOTE token may discuss the operation of the DAO or the frequency of issuance of $ UBI
