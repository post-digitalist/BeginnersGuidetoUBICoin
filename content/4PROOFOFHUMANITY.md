# Proof of Humanity

Proof of humanity is a registry of tokenized identities subject to joint review, developed by Kleros.

Profile requests are approved by members to verify that they are human, but may then be challenged by other members if there is any doubt about the profile's authenticity.

If a bot or a duplicate profile is detected, it will be deleted from the network and barred from claiming $UBI in the future.

Whoever wants to challenge a user profile, will put a small portion of their assets at stake, that can be lost if they wrongly judge a profile as false. This generates a healthy moderation incentive and prevents attempts at censorship. 

Each user with a VOTE token may discuss the operation of a DAO or the frequency of issuance of $UBI.

This network of trust between non-duplicated and non-automated identities is the base of a transparent and democratic system.
