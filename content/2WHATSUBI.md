# What's $UBI?

<img src="/UBI.svg" alt="Featured image" class="feat-img"/>

$UBI is an Ethereum-based prototype for a Universal Basic Income system, fruit of a joint effort by [the Democracy Earth Foundation](http://democracy.earth) and [Kleros](http://kleros.io). 

Its primordial goal is to develop a sustainable, decentralized model of non-exploitable digital identities. By doing so, the project addresses problems that hamper the inclussion of new users, thus paving the way to a more democratic blockchain. 

Until now, the lack of a reliable way of determine Sybill-proof (non duplicated, non-fake) identities restricted the use of the blockchain to a stake-based political system. 

[Proof of Humanity](http://proofofhumanity.id) (POH) is a radical change in the crypto ecosystem, and is the chosen method for governance implementation in the $UBI project. 

The $UBI project consists of two ERC-20 tokens emmited by a DAO:

- UBI Coin ($UBI), which which acts like money (transferrable, storable, expendable)
- The VOTE token ($VOTE), which acts like a voter ID and is given to individuals who verify their identity

$UBI has a stable minting rate per second, using UNIXtime as the standard clock, but the rate can be changed democratically through VOTE in the UBI DAO interface. The token also has a "Burn" function to balance $UBI's innate inflationary tendency. To avoid plutocratic tendences in the token's governance, a quadratic voting system will be implemented. The tokens are given to every verified user through the Proof of Humanity protocol.

The "1 person 1 vote" dream has become true in the Blockchain.
