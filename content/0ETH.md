# What's Ethereum?

Often seen as "the second" blockchain network, or "Bitcoin's sibling", Ethereum is a decentralized and fully programable platform. 

Ethereum was launched in 2015 by a team led by Vitalik Buterin, as an open-source alternative to Bitcoin. Its network is built over a sucession of non-hierarchical nodes that validate transactions according to a pre-established set of rules. This allows users to safely hold and trade ETH -its native cryptocurrency- with complete anonimity, as well as creating new tokens which inherit the inmutable characteristics of the network.

The environment where Smart Contracts are executed is the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It is responsible for dictating the rules and conditions for validating the contracts and transactions, assuring a safe consensus about the functioning of the network. This removes the need for intermediaries in order to make transactions, and allows to run programs that are consistent and secure. These programs are called Decentralized Apps (DApps), and their main feature is that their code is held by every node of the network, so the removal of one node won't stop the execution of Smart Contracts.

Overall, the Ethereum architecture allows for a more political approach to crypto and finance. It encourages users to implement lending protocols, investment mechanisms and governance.
