# What's Ethereum?

Often seen as "the second" blockchain network, or "the Bitcoin's sibling", Ethereum is a decentralized and fully programable platform. 

The Ethereum network is built over a sucession of non-hierarchical nodes that validate transactions according to a pre-established set of rules. This allows users to safely hold and trade ETH -its native cryptocurrency- with complete anonimity, as well as creating new tokens which inherit the inmutable characteristics of the network.
