# How Does the Ethereum Network Work?

Ether is generated through the Proof-of-Work system, as a reward for miners for adding new blocks to the network. This works as an incentive for miners to validate transactions (named GAS), which are "written" inside the blocks. Whenever a block is generated, the information is shared between all peer members of the network, generating consensus about the validness of a transaction. 

There are two types of accounts integrating the network: User Accounts and Smart Contracts. Both have an address that can hold ETH, but Only User Accounts can create transactions.

Smart Contracts consist of code that can be executed by calling one of its conditions. Smart contracts store a predefined amount of ETH that they can send.
