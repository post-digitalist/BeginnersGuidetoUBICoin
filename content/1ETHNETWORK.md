# How Does the Ethereum Network Work?

Ether is generated through the Proof-of-Work system, as a reward for miners for adding new blocks to the network. This works as an incentive for miners to validate transactions (named GAS), which are "written" inside the blocks. Whenever a block is generated, the information is shared between all peer members of the network, generating consensus about the validness of a transaction. 

There are two types of accounts in the Ethereum network: 
- User Accounts
- Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts consist of pieces of code that can be executed by calling one of its conditions. Smart contracts store a predefined amount of ETH that they can send. 
Both have an address that can hold ETH, but Only User Accounts can create transactions.
