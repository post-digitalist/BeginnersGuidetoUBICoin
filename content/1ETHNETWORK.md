# How Does the Ethereum Network Work?

Ether is generated through the Proof-of-Work system, as a reward for miners for adding new blocks to the network. This works as an incentive for miners for validating transactions (named GAS), which are "written" inside the blocks. Whenever a block is generated, the information is shared between all peer members of the network, generating consensus about the validness of a transaction. 

There are two types of accounts who integrate the network: User Accounts and Smart Contracts. Both are composed of an address which can hold ETH, but Only User Accounts can create transactions.

Smart Contracts are built of a code that can be executed by calling one of its conditions, and they can send a predefined amount of ETH stored in the contract.
