The UBI Coin project consists of two ERC-20 tokens: 
- UBI Coin, which which acts like money (transferrable, storable, expendable)
- VOTE token, which acts like a voter ID and is given to individuals who verify their identity

UBI Coin has a stable minting rate per second, using UNIXtime as the standard clock, but the rate can be changed democratically through VOTE. The token also has a "Burn" function to balance the UBICoin innate inflationary tendency. To avoid plutocratic tendences in the token governance, a quadratic voting system.
The tokens are given to every registered user through the Proof of Humanity protocol.
