# The Problem of Gas 

Gas, or Gwei, is the unit that accounts for the amount of ETH that miners obtain as fees, when they validate and write a transaction into the blockchain. The sender can choose the amount of ETH they will pay as a comission, which will determine the speed of the transaction. The higher the fee, the faster the transaction. 

In theory, Gas should be proportional to the amount of computational resources spent by a node to write a transaction into the blockchain. But as DeFi scaled up in 2018, big investors were willing to pay higher Gas fees to force the network to process their transactions faster. This made Gas prices skyrocket up to 5 times compared to previous years, making mining more profitable, but also disuading minor investors and newcomers from using the Ethereum network. 

With the "gentrification" of Ethereum, came a high barrier of entry for both aspiring new investors and developers wanting to build in the DApp ecosystem, hampering the democratic spirit of the blockchain. 

This is the problem that UBIcoin aspires to solve.
