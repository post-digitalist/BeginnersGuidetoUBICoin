# The Problem of GAS
Gas, or Gwei, is the unit that accounts for the amount of ETH that miners obtain as transaction fees, when they validate and write it into the blockchain. The sender can choose the amount of ETH that will pay as a comission, and of course higher amounts act as an incentive for miners to processs that transaction faster.

The GAS should be proportional to the amount of computational resources spent by a node write transactions in the blockchain. But as DeFi scaled up in 2018, big investors were willing to pay higher Gas fees to force the network to process their transactions faster. This made Gas prices skyrocket up to 5 times compared to previous years, making mining more profitable, but also disuading minor investors and newcomers from using the Ethereum network. 

This kind of "gentrification" of Ethereum acts like an entry barrier for new developers who want to build the DApp ecosystem, hampering the democratic spirit of the blockchain.
